Sorts the array in index-wise manner
begins by sorting the first two elements
then proceeds to 3 elements
    - the code first checks if 2nd index is less than the 1st and swaps
    - then checks of 1st index is less than the 0th, and swaps
keep repeating the process till end of the array

time complexity = O(n^2)
best case = O(n)
