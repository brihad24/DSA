sorts elements two at a time
working:
1) compares the first two elements, and interchanges the position if the 2nd element is smaller than the 1st
2) goes to the next 2 elements and does step one
3) after the largest element comes to the end, the first pass is done
4) repeats steps 1 and 2 till the 2nd last element is 2nd largest
5) keeps repeating till the array is sorted
