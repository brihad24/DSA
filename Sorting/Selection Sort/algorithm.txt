selection sort selects an element in the array and places it at the index it is supposed to be
working:
1) selects the max value in the array and places it at the last index (sorting by ascending order)
2) checks in the array from start index to end-1 index(since last value is sorted) and selects the max value and places it as  end-1
3) does the same till end-1 == 0

you can do the same with minimum element and place it as the start of the array
