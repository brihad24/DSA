always use when given array has numbers ranging from 1 to n

if we have an array = {3,5,2,1,4}
we know that sorted array = {1,2,3,4,5}
=> that value = index - 1 (3 = 2 - 1)
we use this swap values in the array
- 3, 5, 2, 1, 4
we check the first element = 3
we swap 3 with 2nd index ((3-1)th) element
- 2, 5, 3, 1, 4
we check first element = 2 and swap with 1st index
- 5, 2, 3, 1, 4
we check first element = 5 and swap with with 4th index
- 4, 2, 3, 1, 5
we check first element = 4 and swap with 3rd index
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

at every point, we check the element at the current index to check if it is at the correct position or not
after this check, we move on to the next element at the next index

time complexity = O(n)
