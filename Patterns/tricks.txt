1) run the outer for loop for the number of lines or number of rows in pattern
2) identify how many columns are there in each row
    eg. *
        * *
        * * *
        * * * *
        here, the 1st row has 1 column, the 2nd row has 2 columns and so on
    run the inner loop for the number of columns present in the row
3) what do you need to print (eg. in step 2, we are printing *)

** try to find a relationship between the rows and the columns, usually by a formula
