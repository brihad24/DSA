works on sorted array (ascending)
1) find the middle element of array
2) if target > mid => search in right
   else => search in left
3) if mid == target => we found the element
4) after (2),  new array will consist of elements either to the left or right of the mid
   start and end will be updated according to mid
5) iteratively repeat the process till mid == target

best case scenario:
O(1)

worst case scenario:
O(log(N));              N = size of arary
